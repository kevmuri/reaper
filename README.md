# reaper #
Simple script to view or kill a process on a port.

## Usage ##
There's probably a better way to make this into a real utility, but to use:
1. Drop `reaper` into `/usr/local/bin/reaper`
2. Make executable: `chmod +x reaper`
3. View or kill a process on a specified port: `reaper {-v|-k} [port number]`
